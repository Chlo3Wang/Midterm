      <p>Originally, movies were made for the cinema, that is, they were made to be watched with others.</p>
      <p>All shall be invited to join through a blog, to be a part of this cultural resistance and watch these same films, keeping them alive and resisting the culture of shallowness, the culture of instant gratification and the culture of crass that seems so prevalent in our world today. Let us together be entertained by great entertainment and help the world to rediscover the truth, beauty and goodness in its very midst.</p>
